                <p>Hello, I'm MariEinz, a creative explorer at the intersection of audio engineering and computer
                    science.</p>
                <p>Armed with a degree in audio engineering, I've spent years crafting captivating soundscapes,
                    mastering
                    the art of music production, and diving deep into audio technology. I've fine-tuned my skills in
                    audio software, honing my craft in sound manipulation and storytelling through music.</p>
                <p>But my journey doesn't end there. With a relentless curiosity, I've decided to venture into the world
                    of
                    computer science. This shift represents my dedication to leveraging technology's potential to create
                    innovative audio solutions. My focus is on mastering algorithms, coding languages, and software
                    development to bridge creativity with technology seamlessly.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I love experimenting with audio effects, coding software tools, and blending the
                    boundaries of audio and computer science. I see this dual-degree journey as a pathway to driving the
                    future of audio technology, pioneering immersive auditory experiences.</p>
